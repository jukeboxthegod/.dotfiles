Scripts
1. linux.sh
• Purpose: This script sets up your Linux environment by configuring shell behavior, creating necessary directories, and backing up existing configurations.
• Key Functions:
• Checks if the operating system is Linux; exits with an error if not.
• Creates a .TRASH directory in your home directory if it doesn’t already exist.
• Renames an existing .nanorc file to .bup_nanorc (backup) and logs this action.
• Copies the content of etc/nanorc into a new .nanorc file in your home directory.
• Appends source ~/.dotfiles/etc/bashrc_custom to your .bashrc file to apply custom bash configurations.

2. cleanup.sh
• Purpose: This script reverses the changes made by linux.sh, effectively cleaning up the environment.
• Key Functions:
• Deletes the .nanorc file in your home directory.
• Removes the source ~/.dotfiles/etc/bashrc_custom line from .bashrc using the sed command.
• Deletes the .TRASH directory in your home directory.
